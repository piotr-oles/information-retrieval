# information-retrieval

I'm learning about Information Retrieval, this is a place for my educational
projects.

### Getting started

This project uses Deno. To get started, first you have to install the runtime:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

You can check if it works by running:

```sh
deno --version
```

To setup your development environment (for example Visual Studio Code), please
follow
[the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/).

### Running existing project

To run the project, simply use `deno run <file>` command:

```sh
deno run projects/<my-project>/main.ts
```

### Adding new project

To add new project, you can leverage `deno init` command:

```sh
cd projects
deno init my-project-name
```

This will scaffold all files required to get started
